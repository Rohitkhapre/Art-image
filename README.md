# Car Art Using NumPy and OpenCV
Create a simple and visually appealing car art using Python and popular libraries like NumPy and OpenCV. The code generates a basic representation of a car on a blank canvas, complete with a body, roof, wheels, and a center line. The car will be centered on the canvas to create a visually balanced artwork.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```python
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or copy the code from the provided Python script.
2. Run the Python script to generate the car art.
``` Python
python art.ipynb
```
1. A window will pop up showing the car art. Press any key to close the window.

## Customization
You can customize the car art by adjusting the following parameters in the script:

- width and height: Change the canvas size to modify the overall size of the car art.

- car_width and car_height: Adjust the dimensions of the car's body.

- wheel_radius: Change the radius of the car's wheels.

- roof_points: Modify the points to change the shape of the car's roof.

- Colors: You can change the colors of the car's body, roof, wheels, and center line by modifying the RGB values in the code.

- Feel free to experiment and add more details to create your unique car art!
